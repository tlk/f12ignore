# Chrome extension to disable the F12 keyboard shortcut

This browser extension will disable the F12 keybord shortcut in Chrome.
Without this extension Chrome will open the Chrome Developer Tools window when the F12 key is pressed.
With this extension installed nothing will happen when the F12 key is pressed.


## Incognito mode

The extension is not enabled in incognito mode by default.
It can be enabled via the Chrome extension settings.


## Credits

This is basically just a stripped down version of the excellent [Shortkeys extension](https://github.com/mikecrittenden/shortkeys) by Mike Crittenden and [Mousetrap.js](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap) by Craig Campbell.

Prior art: The [Disable F12](http://nemrod.se/chrome-extensions/disable-f12-developer-console-chrome/) extension from 2011 does the same thing.
